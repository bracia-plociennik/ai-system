### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
Historical planning-only assumptions are superseded by explicit current authorization, not silently inferred.

### Evidence
Accepted task contract compared to reconciled ten-task plan, architecture and exact current owner scope. Technical001-009 acceptance criteria are unchanged; concrete implemented producers/consumers and predecessor Quality have been reviewed. Spec010 is conditional/deferred design only: current interface overlay matches implemented APIs, expected pilot source remains an explicit future owner gate and no runnable kit, human outcome or activation is claimed. No task approval is inferred from artifact QA.

### Review Completeness Gate
- Status: complete
- Reviewed baseline: input table contents and source HEAD above; no product implementation assessed
- Closure freshness: current
- Post-fix full re-review: completed
- Policy-boundary adversarial matrix: completed
- Producer-consumer field audit: completed
- Required-field mapping: complete

### QA Verification Scope
Artifact completeness and dependency/privacy boundaries only; technical stage001-009, deferred010 retains full DoD.

### Artifact QA Completeness Gate
- Owner intent and governing sources reviewed: context.md, decisions/2026-10-02-owner-scope.md and artifact input table
- DoD / phase acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Scope and out-of-scope consistency: aligned
- Artifact / relevant diff review: completed
- Findings-first review: completed
- Failure / rework / dependency scenarios: completed
- Repository and source compatibility: aligned
- Post-fix full artifact re-review: completed
- Evidence reviewed: input table and scenario traces in Evidence
- Skipped or unreadable sources: historical binary inputs not re-audited; they supply no new correctness proof
- Residual risk: Real runtime activation, independent human replay and advisor rules remain separate hard gates.
- Closure freshness: current

### Validation Execution Record
- Semantic QA result: PASS for this artifact only
- Findings/blockers: none unresolved
- Product checks: artifact assessment only; predecessor Quality evidence reviewed, no verdict for the future implementation
- Workflow script applicability: targeted QA evidence/schema validation; not implementation evidence
- Targeted workflow commands: project-scoped check-qa-evidence and check-status-consistency after artifact refresh; actual outcomes recorded separately
- Script evidence role: supporting-only
- Final verdict: PASS

### Gate Decision
Result: PASS
Next route: completed technical task; checkpoint before owner-triggered final assessment

## Owner Decision Checkpoint
Interaction mode: queued. Decision state: clear for approved implementation; runtime activation remains separately gated. Decisions: D01-D10.
## Optional Knowledge Capture
Capture recommended: yes. Target: status/evidence. Owner decision: capture-now within planning scope; later implementation distillation deferred. Privacy/scope check: pass, private ignored runtime.
## Model Recommendation
Frontier/workhorse high reasoning; high-impact provenance/privacy design. Current model unknown. Blocking: no.

#### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
Historical planning-only assumptions are superseded by explicit current authorization, not silently inferred.

#### Evidence
Current accepted task spec re-assessed against unchanged ten-task sequence, architecture, exact owner implementation approval and predecessor interfaces. Identity/actual-time/approval and privacy boundaries are coherent. Pilot010 specification is valid as conditional design only; human replay/access/cutover remain unmet and no implementation readiness is claimed.

##### Findings
- Blockers: none
- Unresolved findings: none
Warnings: task remains conditional. This verdict accepts the specification and its blocked implementation gate, not execution permission or completed dependencies.

##### Evidence
Identity/ownership reviewed against every consumer: task binding is optional, work UUID is canonical, physical vault does not assign ownership. Unknown/date/interval/aggregate union is explicit; actual versus estimated distinct. Negative-space check: unsafe root and unknown schema rejected before reads/writes; no migration shortcut. Unit cases distinguish booleans from numbers and zero from a missing duration. No material field omission affecting design found.

Producer-consumer field audit: trace source identities, versions, ownership, evidence type, visibility and approval into only this task's output; no fallback that converts missing data into confirmed values. Concrete future tests in spec were reviewed for corresponding failure and success outcomes. Second pass challenged scope boundaries and dependency order against canonical plan; no remaining material design finding.

##### Review Completeness Gate
- Status: complete
- Reviewed baseline: input table contents and source HEAD above; no product implementation assessed
- Closure freshness: current
- Post-fix full re-review: not-required
- Policy-boundary adversarial matrix: completed
- Producer-consumer field audit: completed
- Required-field mapping: complete

##### QA Verification Scope
Compatibility re-review: task index now uses the runtime validator's explicit task-card column, workspace-qualified paths and absent implementation Quality as none. Canonical plan names future Quality targets without claiming they exist. Scope, dependencies, DoD and conditional gates unchanged; refreshed input hashes bind this exact final set.
Solo specification reviewed against owner intent, architecture, plan, task index, DoD and risk. Conditional predecessor/activation gates are explicit and require refresh before phase4. No product tests executed.

##### Artifact QA Completeness Gate
- Owner intent and governing sources reviewed: context.md, decisions/2026-10-02-owner-scope.md and artifact input table
- DoD / phase acceptance criteria reviewed: yes
- Scope and out-of-scope consistency: aligned
- Artifact / relevant diff review: completed
- Findings-first review: completed
- Failure / rework / dependency scenarios: completed
- Repository and source compatibility: aligned
- Post-fix full artifact re-review: not-required
- Evidence reviewed: input table and scenario traces in Evidence
- Skipped or unreadable sources: historical binary inputs not re-audited; they supply no new correctness proof
- Residual risk: No unresolved design choice. Actual runtime roots and entity aliases need owner-approved activation later.
- Closure freshness: current

##### Validation Execution Record
- Semantic QA result: PASS for this artifact only
- Findings/blockers: none unresolved
- Product checks: not-applicable; no product code implemented in planning-range
- Workflow script applicability: targeted QA evidence/schema validation; not implementation evidence
- Targeted workflow commands: final project-scoped check-qa-evidence and check-status-consistency; command outcomes recorded in reviews/planning-verification.md
- Script evidence role: supporting-only
- Final verdict: PASS

##### Gate Decision
Result: PASS
Next route: next solo task specification / stop before implementation

#### Owner Decision Checkpoint
Interaction mode: queued. Decision state: clear for planning; implementation and activation approvals remain separate. Decisions: D01-D10.
#### Optional Knowledge Capture
Capture recommended: yes. Target: status/evidence. Owner decision: capture-now within planning scope; later implementation distillation deferred. Privacy/scope check: pass, private ignored runtime.
#### Model Recommendation
Frontier/workhorse high reasoning; high-impact provenance/privacy design. Current model unknown. Blocking: no.
